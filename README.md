# GPT-for-Web
Create your own GPT-powered AI chat app UI for your website with pure HTML, CSS, JS.

# Steps
### METHOD 1
1. Fork this repository.
2. You need to get your own OpenAI API key.** FREE options üëá**

	If you want to get *free APIs*, check this GitHub Repo: https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free

	**Example:**
If you acquired your free API key from https://discord.pawan.krd , then change the following lines of code:

	In chatbot.js, line 58: (apiURL)` https://api.pawan.krd/v1/chat/completions`

	In chatbot.js, line 61: (apiKEY) `pk-****************************` [the one you got from their discord]

	In chatbot.js, line 65: (model) `pai-001-light`

	If you are using the official OpenAI API key from [openai.com](http://openai.com "openai.com"), you need not change any part of the code. Just replace your API key in line 61 and deploy.
4. **Deploy** on Vercel, Railway, HuggingFace.
